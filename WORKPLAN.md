## Basic Project Description

In this project we will predict movies revenue based on a combination of movie metadata (e.g. budget, genre, cast, director....) and user reviews (sentiment analysis). Secondly, we'd like to investigate how crucial elements like budget, genre or audience response affect a film's financial performance using some of NLP tools for sentiment analysis and regression models.

### Main Goal or Research Question (not final)

* What factors have the most significant impact on movie revenue?
* Can we predict movie revenue accurately using pre-release features (budget, cast, director)?
* How do audience and critic reviews influence box office success?

### Data

We plan to either scrape the data from the IMBD website or use already existing dataset in case we will not be able to obtain sufficient data volume for the analysis.
